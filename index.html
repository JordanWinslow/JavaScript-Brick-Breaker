      The purpose of this "game" is purely educational and is aimed at
      demonstrating my knowledge of vanilla javascript.
      <br /><br />
      The game utilizes an array of 0's and 1's to generate a series of bricks
      with HTML Canvas.
      <br /><br />
      Each brick is a classical JavaScript object that is assigned a boolean
      "destroyed" state and uses an implementation of axis-aligned bounding box
      collision detection I created to determine if the orb is touching the
      brick on any side during every redraw of the canvas.
      <br /><br />
      The same collision detection is extended on the paddle to determine if the
      ball hits the paddle.
      <br /><br />
      The bricks strobe in color is not a glitch, I was just playing around with
      randomly generating colors on every redraw. Yes it's ugly, but hey, this
      isn't a design project!
      <br /><br />
      The paddle is controlled with event handlers and CSS that converts
      keystrokes to directions for the x and y axis.
      <br /><br />
      One thing I would change if I rewrote this program today would be to write
      it with pure functions and no classes.
